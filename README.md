# Hi! - Quick description:
Live demo: https://vanilla-js-web-components-z3so.vercel.app/index.html (desktop only layout) </br>
This project has been made using vanilla js in order to get "know how" how frameworks could create components, and how routing can be implemented. </br>
I've explored: ShadowDOM, JS classes/objects more deeply, how to implement routing, scss.

# Tech used in project:
JS, SCSS, as mock db served simple json file. </br>
Also to spice a little things up, I have impleented mail contact service through emailjs, please send emails only to yourself. 

# Notes: 
Due to small project size, and my inexperience at the time i didn't care to uphold proper mechanisms and reusability in every component </br>
(mainly those used only in one place with one SPECIFIC specialised purpose, had hardcoded props, stupid ikr but atleast it shows my progress over the time).

# Story: 
How the project emerged? Project has been made in IT technical school (technikum informatyczne) at 3rd or 4th (last) grade as I recall. <br/>
My slovak language teacher asked us to bring crayons etc, to create sth for "day of foreign languages" for exhibition. </br>
Well frankly, I didn't like the idea of spending my time drawing and colouring some stuff on big sheet of paper HENCE... such occurence provided me perfect theme for my project (I've fancied to explore how js frameworks could bring to life such reusability).</br>
I've asked 2 of my classmates to help me with research of more specific slovak attractions to populate web app with actual content for presenting data on stage. </br>
They've helped a lot with research and content direction. (Kacper B. and Adrian M., thanks guys).
